Today, I got up to #25, "HTML Attributes". We only learned simple stuff like basic
tags and attributes. This includes links, images, and lists.

Today, I finished up the HTML section where I did forms and that good stuff.

After lounging around for a couple days, I'm back. I'm learning about
specificity and inheritance. Pretty much, if you style a parent element,
the child will inherit those style changes. Make the ul purple, the li
inside will be purple. 
I just finished up the introduction to CSS. I'm a bit iffy on some of
language such as elements and stuff, but that'll clear up the more as I
progress.
